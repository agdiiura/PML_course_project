## Course Project

### Load data

We load data from the directory `data`.

```{r}
training_name = "data/pml-training.csv"
testing_name = "data/pml-testing.csv"

training = read.csv(training_name, na.strings=c("", "NA"))
testing = read.csv(testing_name, na.strings=c("", "NA"))
```

Using the command `head` we investigate the training dataset, the output is quite long thus we do not show it here. The datasets have dimensions 

```{r}
dim(training)
dim(testing)
```
